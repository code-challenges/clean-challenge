1. Call this API (just open the link in the browser)
https://api.hellogenio.com/common/global/test/android/sample/data
It contains a list of data, a header, and a footer.
For data objects where type is data_0 show the image on the right side as a circular image and for data_1 on the left side, just like a messaging app.
2. When the user clicks on any data view, take user the map view and let the user select an address. Use Google map and any API from Google for searching the address. Get the address and Lat+Lng of the selected item based on the user search result.
